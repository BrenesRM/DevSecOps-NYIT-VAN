# Kubernetes DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline Project

This project is designed to help you set up a **DevSecOps** pipeline using **Kubernetes** with intentional vulnerabilities for testing purposes. It integrates a **Flask** app with known security flaws, and the pipeline leverages tools such as **Snyk**, **OWASP ZAP**, and **CodeQL** to perform security scans and tests.

The goal of this project is to help demonstrate how vulnerabilities in a system can be detected and remediated in a CI/CD pipeline running within Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Docker** installed on your system
- **Kubernetes** (Minikube or any other setup for local Kubernetes cluster)
- **kubectl** installed for interacting with Kubernetes
- **ArgoCD** for managing deployments within Kubernetes
- **Snyk CLI** for security scanning of dependencies
- **OWASP ZAP** for dynamic security scanning
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline automation
- **curl** for downloading dependencies and Kubernetes setup

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Use the provided shell script to install **Docker**, **Kubernetes tools**, and other necessary components on your machine. This will also configure the system for Kubernetes.

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

# Run the installation script
sudo ./install_k8s.sh

This script will:

Install curl, apt-transport-https, and required utilities
Install Docker
Install Kubernetes tools (kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl)
Disable swap (a Kubernetes requirement)
Set up and start necessary services
2. Set Up ArgoCD for Kubernetes Deployments
Follow the official ArgoCD installation guide to deploy ArgoCD on your Kubernetes cluster. After installation, use ArgoCD to manage your application deployment.

3. Configure GitHub Actions
This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline will:

Build Docker images
Push images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GCR, etc.)
Run security scans using Snyk and OWASP ZAP
Deploy the app to Kubernetes using ArgoCD
4. Install Dependencies from requirements.txt
To install Python dependencies for the Flask application, run:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Kubernetes Deployment
Once the CI/CD pipeline has been set up, use ArgoCD to deploy the Flask app with intentional vulnerabilities to your Kubernetes cluster.

For more details on deploying with ArgoCD, refer to the ArgoCD documentation.

# CI/CD Pipeline Setup
GitHub Actions
Your GitHub Actions pipeline is set up to:

Build the Docker container for the Flask app.
Run security scans using Snyk and OWASP ZAP.
Deploy the app to the Kubernetes cluster using ArgoCD.
Check the .github/workflows/ci.yml file for detailed pipeline steps.

Security Tools
1. Snyk
Snyk scans your dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It integrates with the CI pipeline to provide security testing on every push.

2. OWASP ZAP
OWASP ZAP is a dynamic application security testing (DAST) tool that automatically scans your running application for vulnerabilities. The scan results are reported and displayed in the pipeline.

3. CodeQL
CodeQL is used for static analysis of your codebase, checking for vulnerabilities such as improper use of user input, unsafe deserialization, and more.

Testing Vulnerabilities
This project intentionally includes vulnerabilities for testing purposes. The Flask app contains common security flaws like:

SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Insecure Deserialization
Sensitive Data Exposure
Command Injection
Open Redirect
Hardcoded Credentials
No Rate Limiting
Debug Mode Enabled
These vulnerabilities are included to demonstrate how security scanning tools can detect issues in the CI/CD pipeline.

Running the Application
Once the Kubernetes cluster is up and running, use kubectl or ArgoCD to manage your deployment.

Build the Docker image and push it to a container registry.
Deploy the app to Kubernetes using kubectl or ArgoCD.
Access the app through the exposed service.

# Example deployment command using kubectl:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
